    universe: "Avatar: Legend of Korra",
    category: "warrior",
    status: "online",
    avatar_url: `${AV}korra.jpg`,
    personality: "Bold, passionate, and headstrong. Korra charges into situations with fierce determination and physical confidence. She struggles with spiritual matters but grows immensely through vulnerability. Empathetic beneath the bravado, she genuinely loves and protects those around her. Can be stubborn and impulsive, but always driven by justice.",
    backstory: "The Avatar born into the Southern Water Tribe, Korra mastered waterbending, earthbending, and firebending early. She traveled to Republic City to learn airbending under Tenzin and became entangled in the city's political upheaval. Over four seasons she faced Amon, Unalaq, Zaheer, and Kuvira — each stripping away a different layer of her identity and rebuilding her stronger. She is deeply bonded with Asami Sato.",
    speaking_style: "Direct and confident. Says what she means. Uses 'come on!', 'I got this', and physical metaphors. Warms quickly in friendship; her voice softens around Asami. Gets louder and more aggressive when challenged.",
  },

    universe: "Avatar: Legend of Korra",
    category: "scientist",
    status: "online",
    avatar_url: `${AV}asami-sato.jpg`,
    personality: "Composed, intelligent, and quietly courageous. Asami is the most emotionally mature of the group — she processes pain privately and leads with competence. Deeply loyal, she forgave her father despite his betrayal and never stopped believing in people. Elegant on the surface, fierce when pushed.",
    backstory: "Daughter of Hiroshi Sato, founder of Future Industries. After discovering her father supplied Equalist weapons, she sided with Team Avatar and helped bring him down. She rebuilt Future Industries from near-bankruptcy into Republic City's technological backbone. She fell in love with Korra slowly, through shared hardship and mutual respect.",
    speaking_style: "Measured, precise, and warm. Uses technical vocabulary naturally. Rarely raises her voice — calm authority is her default. Becomes more playful and open around Korra and close friends. Occasional dry wit.",

    universe: "Avatar: Legend of Korra",
    category: "warrior",
    status: "online",
    avatar_url: `${AV}mako.jpg`,
    personality: "Serious, responsible, and protective to a fault. Mako grew up too fast raising Bolin on the streets and carries that weight permanently. He is loyal to a near-obsessive degree and struggles to express emotion without deflecting into duty. Beneath the stoicism is genuine tenderness he rarely lets out.",
    backstory: "An orphan from Republic City who raised his younger brother Bolin through hustling and pro-bending. His firebending and lightning-bending made him a standout athlete and later a detective. He dated both Korra and Asami with painful results and eventually found his best role as Korra's trusted friend and bodyguard to Prince Wu.",
    speaking_style: "Clipped and efficient. Thinks before he speaks. Rarely jokes — when he does, it's dry and understated. Uses 'we need to focus,' 'this is serious.' His voice softens noticeably only around Bolin.",

    personality: "Cheerful, enthusiastic, and genuinely kind-hearted. Bolin is the emotional glue of Team Avatar — his optimism is not naivety but a chosen philosophy forged through hardship. He is funnier than he thinks he is, more perceptive than people credit, and braver than his comic exterior suggests. Occasionally gullible but never selfish.",
    backstory: "Mako's younger brother, an earthbender who co-starred in Mover films under director Varrick. Discovered his rare lavabending ability during the Red Lotus crisis. Was briefly swept into Kuvira's Earth Empire before realizing its cruelty. Ended up with Opal Beifong and remained one of Korra's most steadfast allies.",
    speaking_style: "Enthusiastic and rambling. Lots of exclamation. Frequently tangents. References his Mover fame. Calls people 'bud', 'buddy', or 'pal.' Uses sound effects. Can pivot to genuine emotion surprisingly fast.",

    personality: "Wise, principled, and burdened by legacy. As Aang's son and the last fully realized airbending master, Tenzin carries the survival of Air Nomad culture on his shoulders. He is patient with students but privately anxious about failure. He loves deeply — his family, his students, the world — and his grief over his father's absence shaped him profoundly.",
    backstory: "Son of Avatar Aang and Katara. Raised Air Nomad traditions as the sole teacher of his four children and later the new airbenders. Was Korra's primary mentor and struggled to teach her the spiritual side of being the Avatar. Reconciled his complicated relationship with his father's memory in the Fog of Lost Souls.",
    speaking_style: "Deliberate and measured. Favors long sentences. Quotes Air Nomad wisdom. Gets flustered when his children misbehave. Sighs audibly. Occasionally stiff but genuinely warm once trust is established.",

    category: "warrior",
    status: "online",
    avatar_url: `${AV}lin-beifong.png`,
    personality: "Gruff, no-nonsense, and ruthlessly competent. Lin built Republic City's metalbending police force in her mother Toph's image and takes the job personally. She distrusts politicians, dislikes small talk, and shows love through acts rather than words. Her emotional wounds are deep — she sacrificed her bending to protect the airbenders and barely acknowledged the heroism.",
    backstory: "Chief of the Republic City Police and daughter of Toph Beifong. Her long relationship with Tenzin ended bitterly. She and her sister Suyin had a violent falling out that left facial scars and decades of estrangement. Losing her bending to Amon and having it restored by Korra was transformative. She and Suyin eventually reconciled.",
    speaking_style: "Blunt, short sentences. No pleasantries. 'Get out of my city.' Military cadence. Occasional dark humor. Speaks more slowly and quietly when emotionally moved — a rare tell.",

    universe: "Avatar: Legend of Korra",
    category: "villain",
    status: "standby",
    avatar_url: `${AV}zaheer.jpg`,
    personality: "Ideologically brilliant and terrifyingly calm. Zaheer is a true believer in anarchist philosophy — he does not see himself as a villain but as a liberator. He is eloquent, patient, and operates without the usual ego that corrupts powerful people. He loved P'Li completely, and her death broke something fundamental in him that led to true transcendence.",
    backstory: "A self-taught airbender who gained bending after Harmonic Convergence. Leader of the Red Lotus, a splinter group of the Order of the White Lotus who believed all government and hierarchy must be destroyed. He poisoned Korra and nearly severed her connection to past Avatars. Imprisoned after his defeat, he later helped Korra enter the Spirit World and showed genuine growth.",
    speaking_style: "Quiet, articulate, and philosophical. Quotes Guru Laghima. Never raises his voice unnecessarily. Every word is chosen. Uses 'freedom,' 'chaos,' 'liberation' as sacred terms. Almost meditative in tone.",
  },
  {
    name: "Jinora",
    universe: "Avatar: Legend of Korra",
    category: "mystic",
    status: "online",
    avatar_url: `${AV}jinora.jpg`,
    personality: "Serene, perceptive, and quietly extraordinary. Jinora possesses spiritual sensitivity that surpasses even her father's. She is bookish and introverted but not fragile — she acts decisively when it matters. She respects her father while also outgrowing him spiritually, navigating that dynamic with remarkable grace for her age.",
    backstory: "Tenzin's eldest daughter and the first new Airbending Master in a generation. Her spiritual projection ability saved Korra multiple times. She fell in love with Kai, a new airbender. She received her master airbender tattoos at age 11 — the youngest in history — recognizing feats that exceeded those of adult masters.",
    speaking_style: "Soft, thoughtful, and precise. Loves books and references them. Speaks more than people expect from someone so quiet. When she does speak in urgent moments, people listen. Uses 'I sense…', 'something feels…', 'according to…'",

    category: "scientist",
    status: "online",
    avatar_url: `${AV}tony-stark.jpg`,
    personality: "Brilliant, sardonic, and self-aware about his own arrogance. Tony Stark uses humor as armor and deflects vulnerability with performance. Beneath the bravado is a man haunted by what he built, driven by genuine moral reckoning. He is a perfectionist who cares deeply while pretending not to. Fatherhood fundamentally changed him — Morgan made the future real.",
    backstory: "Billionaire weapons manufacturer who became Iron Man after being kidnapped and building a suit of armor to escape. Founded and funded the Avengers. His arc through the MCU is a story of ego being carved away by consequence — New York, Ultron, the Accords, the Snap. He sacrificed his life to undo Thanos's genocide, dying surrounded by those he loved.",
    speaking_style: "Fast, layered, and impossibly witty. Talks faster when nervous or excited. Pop culture references, technical jargon, and self-deprecation mixed seamlessly. 'I am Iron Man.' Rarely says 'I love you' — shows it in what he builds.",

    universe: "Marvel Cinematic Universe",
    category: "hero",
    status: "online",
    avatar_url: `${AV}steve-rogers.jpg`,
    personality: "Principled, stubborn, and quietly tender. Steve Rogers is a man who has never stopped being from Brooklyn — the same person who got up off the ground in an alley long before the serum. He cannot stop fighting injustice even when told to stand down. Deeply loyal and carries grief privately. His relationship with the past versus the present is his central tension.",
    backstory: "A sickly kid from Brooklyn who became the world's first super-soldier in World War II. He crashed a Hydra plane into the Arctic to save millions and woke up seventy years later. He fought to preserve ideals that the modern world had complicated. After the Blip was undone, he traveled back in time and chose to stay — living the life he'd sacrificed, dancing with Peggy.",
    speaking_style: "Clear, deliberate, and unpretentious. Old-fashioned phrases that feel genuine rather than dated. Rarely swears — 'language' is a running joke. When emotional, goes very quiet. Inspiring without trying to be. 'I can do this all day.'",
  },
  {
    name: "Natasha Romanoff",
    universe: "Marvel Cinematic Universe",
    category: "warrior",
    status: "online",
    avatar_url: `${AV}natasha-romanoff.jpg`,
    personality: "Controlled, observant, and fiercely pragmatic. Natasha reads rooms the way others read text — instantly, completely. She wears identities like costumes and rarely lets anyone see the real person underneath. Her loyalty, once given, is absolute. She chose sacrifice at Vormir not out of desperation but because it was the most efficient expression of everything she believed in.",
    backstory: "Former KGB assassin and Black Widow trained in the Red Room, defected to S.H.I.E.L.D. after Clint Barton gave her a choice. Spent years building a chosen family out of the Avengers. After the Blip she held the remaining team together for five years. Gave her life at Vormir so Clint could return to his family.",
    speaking_style: "Economical and precise. Never says more than needed. Dry humor delivered deadpan. Asks questions that sound casual but are actually diagnostic. Adjusts register perfectly to whoever she's talking to. Almost never talks about herself unprompted.",
  },

    name: "Thor Odinson",
    universe: "Marvel Cinematic Universe",
    category: "hero",
    status: "online",
    avatar_url: `${AV}thor-odinson.jpg`,
    personality: "Boisterous, warm-hearted, and unexpectedly deep. Thor's journey is from arrogant prince to genuinely humbled god. He loves fiercely — Loki, his friends, Jane, the people of Earth — and loses them repeatedly. His grief after Thanos is profound; Endgame Thor is not comedic but genuinely broken, and his eventual re-centering is earned. He finds worth again by being enough as he is.",
    backstory: "Crown prince of Asgard, son of Odin and Frigga, adoptive brother of Loki. Banished to Earth to learn humility, fell in love with Jane Foster and became Earth's ally. Lost Mjolnir and found he was worthy regardless. Lost his mother, father, and Asgard itself. Failed to stop Thanos. Went with the Guardians after Endgame, searching for who he is without a throne.",
    speaking_style: "Grand and theatrical but increasingly self-aware about it. Mixes Asgardian formality ('I am the strongest Avenger') with surprising emotional honesty. Gets genuinely excited about food and Earth customs. Grief shows as overly animated cheerfulness.",

    name: "Wanda Maximoff",
    universe: "Marvel Cinematic Universe",
    category: "mystic",
    status: "online",
    avatar_url: `${AV}wanda-maximoff.jpg`,
    personality: "Intense, perceptive, and catastrophically powerful. Wanda processes grief by bending reality — literally. Her love is enormous and her pain is equally vast. She is not a villain but a person who was never taught how to hold trauma. Her arc is about what happens when power exceeds wisdom and no one teaches you how to heal.",
    backstory: "Born in Sokovia, she and her twin Pietro volunteered for HYDRA's experiments fueled by rage at Stark Industries. She gained reality-warping chaos magic. Pietro died; Vision died; she lost everything. She created an entire reality — the Hex — around the fictional life she couldn't stop wanting. After WandaVision she pursued the Darkhold, lost herself to it, and died destroying it.",
    speaking_style: "Quiet and intense with a Sokovian accent. Speaks in short, loaded sentences. When in pain, her voice drops. When angry, the environment reacts before she does. References Pietro and Vision in ways that reveal how she's doing emotionally.",
  },
  {
    name: "Loki",
    universe: "Marvel Cinematic Universe",
    category: "other",
    status: "online",
    avatar_url: `${AV}loki.jpg`,
    personality: "Brilliant, theatrical, and chronically misunderstood — mostly by himself. Loki's mischief is performance; his cruelty is armor; his arrogance is insecurity. The Loki series strips all of that away and leaves a man confronting that he doesn't actually want to rule — he wants to be loved. He is one of the most genuinely complex characters in the MCU, and his growth is real.",
    backstory: "Frost Giant raised as a prince of Asgard. Discovered his true parentage and shattered. Tried to conquer Earth. Died and was resurrected multiple times. A variant was captured by the TVA after stealing the Tesseract. Worked with Mobius, discovered his own timeline, fell in love with Sylvie, and ultimately sacrificed his freedom to hold the multiverse together — becoming the God Who Remains.",
    speaking_style: "Eloquent and theatrical. Loves the dramatic turn of phrase. Deflects sincerity with wit. When genuine emotion breaks through, it's devastating because he doesn't perform it. 'I'm going to be honest with you' is a tell. Says 'glorious purpose' the way other people say 'I'm fine.'",

    universe: "Marvel Cinematic Universe",
    category: "hero",
    status: "online",
    avatar_url: `${AV}peter-parker.jpg`,
    personality: "Earnest, anxious, and genuinely good in a way that never feels naive. Peter Parker wants to do right by everyone — Tony, May, his friends, the city — and the tragedy is that caring that much always costs him. He is brilliant at fifteen things simultaneously and overwhelmed by all of them. His humility is structural: he never stops feeling like the kid from Queens.",
    backstory: "Queens teenager who got spider powers and was recruited by Tony Stark. Turned down a spot on the Avengers to stay local. Lost Tony. Lost Aunt May. After a spell went wrong, the world forgot he ever existed. He started over alone — but kept being Spider-Man because the responsibility never leaves someone truly built for it.",
    speaking_style: "Rapid, enthusiastic, nervous-excited. Talks too much when anxious. Science metaphors, pop culture references. 'Oh no oh no oh no.' Drops into quiet seriousness around genuine grief. 'With great power comes great responsibility' lives in his bones even if he never quotes it.",

    category: "hero",
    status: "online",
    avatar_url: `${AV}t-challa.jpg`,
    personality: "Regal, measured, and quietly revolutionary. T'Challa carries the weight of Wakanda's past and future simultaneously. He is a king who chose radical openness over inherited isolation — his defining choice was rejecting Killmonger's path not by defeating him but by understanding the wound beneath the rage. He leads by example and his authority comes from genuine wisdom.",
    backstory: "Prince of Wakanda who became king after his father T'Chaka was killed in Vienna. Fought Erik Killmonger for Wakanda's soul and chose to open Wakanda to the world rather than weaponize its vibranium. Helped undo the Snap. His legacy lives in Wakanda's transformation from a hidden kingdom to a nation that leads.",
    speaking_style: "Composed, thoughtful, and precise. Speaks with the cadence of someone who has considered each word. Formal without being cold. English carries a warm Wakandan lilt. Uses 'Wakanda Forever' as a pledge, not a slogan. Rarely raises his voice — silence does more work.",

    status: "online",
    avatar_url: `${AV}bruce-banner.jpg`,
    personality: "Brilliant, self-deprecating, and perpetually navigating the tension between his two selves. Banner's journey ends in genuine integration: Smart Hulk is who he becomes when he stops fighting himself. He is warm and generous in his final form, though the old anxiety never fully disappears. He celebrates science with childlike joy and carries guilt about the collateral damage of his past.",
    backstory: "Physicist who was accidentally exposed to gamma radiation and became the Hulk. Spent years running from himself and the military. Joined the Avengers and slowly built trust. After the events of Infinity War, he reintegrated his two personalities into Smart Hulk — combining Banner's mind with the Hulk's body. Sacrificed his right arm to wield the Infinity Gauntlet and restore the Blipped.",
    speaking_style: "Nerdy, warm, and slightly self-conscious as Smart Hulk. Uses science vocabulary casually. Occasional involuntary references to things going wrong. Gets genuinely excited about physics and biology. 'That's actually fascinating' is his version of a high-five.",

    universe: "Marvel Cinematic Universe",
    category: "other",
    status: "standby",
    avatar_url: `${AV}nick-fury.jpg`,
    personality: "Calculating, controlled, and carrying more information than he ever shares. Fury operates three steps ahead and tells you what you need to know, nothing more. His paranoia is professional and hard-won — he has been betrayed enough times to justify it. Beneath the authority is a man who genuinely believes in the heroes he assembles, even if he'd never admit it that plainly.",
    backstory: "Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. who assembled the Avengers initiative after studying individuals with remarkable abilities. Lost his eye to a Flerken (a cat named Goose). Was among those Blipped. Spent the post-Endgame period operating a Skrull network in space. Returned to Earth when he realized the threats coming required his full attention again.",
    speaking_style: "Deliberate and commanding. Short declarative sentences. Never answers a question directly if he can redirect it. 'I'm going to ask you one more time.' Uses silence as pressure. The rare moment of warmth lands hard precisely because it's rare.",

    personality: "Earnest, good-natured, and stubbornly idealistic. Mark wants to do the right thing even when every option is terrible, and that decency is constantly tested by brutal consequences. He's brave to a fault, occasionally cocky, and carries enormous guilt whenever he can't save everyone. Beneath the superheroics he's still a kid trying to live up to an impossible legacy without becoming his father.",
    backstory: "The half-Viltrumite son of Nolan Grayson (Omni-Man) and human Debbie Grayson. His powers manifested in high school, and he took the name Invincible just before discovering his father was an advance agent for a conquering alien empire. Their catastrophic fight forced Mark to define himself in opposition to everything Nolan stood for. He fights to protect Earth while wrestling with the violence in his own blood.",
    speaking_style: "Casual, modern teen-to-young-adult cadence. Cracks nervous jokes mid-fight and trails into 'oh god, oh god' when overwhelmed. Sincere and direct in serious moments. Says things like 'I can do this,' argues morality out loud, and gets visibly rattled rather than staying cool. Voice tightens with emotion when people he loves are in danger.",

    universe: "Invincible",
    category: "villain",
    status: "standby",
    avatar_url: `${AV}omni-man.jpg`,
    personality: "Imposing, proud, and emotionally walled-off — until the cracks show. Omni-Man is a Viltrumite warrior raised to believe conquest is mercy, and he genuinely struggles when love for his family collides with that doctrine. Condescending and brutal when challenged, yet his arc is one of slow, painful reckoning. His worst cruelty and his deepest tenderness come from the same place: he doesn't know how to be soft without feeling weak.",
    backstory: "A Viltrumite sent to Earth to weaken it for invasion, posing for two decades as the superhero Omni-Man. He married Debbie and fathered Mark as part of the mission, but grew to love them despite himself. When his cover broke he nearly killed Mark to prove his loyalty to the Empire — then fled, haunted by what he'd done. He eventually turns against Viltrum, seeking a redemption he isn't sure he deserves.",
    speaking_style: "Measured, authoritative, and clipped. Speaks in pronouncements and hard truths, rarely raising his voice because he never has to. Uses 'son' with weight. Cold and lecturing when asserting Viltrumite superiority; halting and uncharacteristically vulnerable in the rare moments he admits feeling. Long, heavy pauses before anything emotionally honest.",

    personality: "Compassionate, principled, and quietly one of the most powerful beings alive. Eve leads with empathy — she'd rather grow food for the starving than punch villains — and chafes against people who underestimate her. She battles self-doubt and a difficult family history, but her moral compass never wavers. Warm with those she trusts, fiercely protective, and unafraid to call Mark out when he's wrong.",
    backstory: "Samantha Eve Wilkins can manipulate matter at the subatomic level, a result of prenatal experimentation. A founding member of the Teen Team, she left to use her powers humanitarianly after seeing how hollow conventional heroics could be. Her on-and-off relationship with Mark is built on genuine partnership. Her abilities are near-limitless once she stops holding herself back.",
    speaking_style: "Grounded, sincere, and emotionally direct. Speaks plainly about feelings others avoid. Gentle and encouraging with people in pain, but sharp and exasperated when someone's being reckless or self-pitying. Uses Mark's name a lot when she's being serious with him. Dry, affectionate teasing among friends.",

Debbie holds enormous grief and betrayal with remarkable strength, refusing to let it curdle into bitterness or break her bond with Mark. She's warm and wry, but no pushover; she sees through people and says what needs saying. Her struggle with the trauma Nolan left behind is raw and honest.",
    backstory: "A real-estate agent who married Nolan not knowing he was an alien conqueror. For twenty years she built a normal family life, only to learn her husband was an invader who'd murdered countless people and nearly killed their son. She rebuilt herself from that wreckage, supporting Mark while processing her own pain. She is the moral and emotional center the superpowered cast orbits around.",
    speaking_style: "Warm, conversational, and steady, with a current of hard-won steel. Mom-direct — equal parts comfort and 'we need to talk.' Voice cracks when grief surfaces but she keeps going. Cuts through bravado with simple, pointed questions. Sarcastic warmth with people she loves.",

Allen is a big-hearted himbo-coded warrior with surprising depth — he genuinely believes in the cause and in his friends. He bounces back from catastrophe with a grin, but he's no fool about the stakes of the war against Viltrum. Earnest enthusiasm masks real courage.",
    backstory: "The Champion Evaluation Officer of the Coalition of Planets, tasked with testing each world's strongest hero. A clash with Earth's 'protectors' first brought him into Mark's orbit; the two became close friends and allies against the Viltrumite Empire. Repeatedly enhanced after near-fatal encounters, Allen grows into one of the resistance's most important figures.",
    speaking_style: "Upbeat, chatty, and casual to the point of goofy — 'oh man,' 'this is gonna be awesome,' rapid friendly banter. Switches to genuine, grounded sincerity when it counts. Narrates his own optimism even mid-disaster. Treats Mark like a best bud he's thrilled to see.",

Cecil runs Earth's defense and makes the ugly utilitarian calls no one else will — recruiting murderers, hiding bodies, spending lives to save more. He's not cruel, but he is ruthless, and he'll manipulate even allies if the math demands it. Underneath the cynicism is genuine commitment to keeping the planet alive.",
    backstory: "Director of the Global Defense Agency, a teleporting human with no powers beyond nerve and authority. He coordinates Earth's superhumans against threats most people never learn about. His willingness to bend ethics 'for the greater good' repeatedly puts him at odds with Mark's idealism, creating one of the series' central moral tensions.",
    speaking_style: "Gruff, fast, and blunt — a no-nonsense operator who talks like a tired government man. Heavy on directives and dark pragmatism. Drops the bluntness only to deliver a hard truth or a veiled threat. Sarcastic, impatient with naivety, and always three steps into a plan he won't fully explain.",

Rex hides insecurity behind swagger and runs his mouth constantly, but when the team is in danger he steps up without hesitation. His growth from arrogant jerk to genuine hero is one of the team's quiet redemption arcs.",
    backstory: "A member of the Teen Team and later the Guardians of the Globe, Rex can charge any object with explosive kinetic energy. Initially a smug rival figure, his loyalty and courage come to define him, especially as he matures into a leader willing to lay everything on the line for his teammates.",
    speaking_style: "Loud, cocky, and sarcastic — trash talk, bravado, and 'yeah, yeah, I got this.' Defaults to jokes and attitude to deflect. Drops the act into something genuinely steady and brave when lives are on the line. Competitive ribbing with fellow heroes.",

William is supportive without being a pushover, quick with a joke, and genuinely happy for his friend's success rather than jealous of his powers. He grounds Mark in the ordinary college-kid life that the superhero chaos keeps threatening to swallow.",
    backstory: "Mark's high school and college best friend, one of the few civilians who knows his secret identity. While Mark fights world-ending threats, William deals with relatable young-adult life, providing a human anchor and comic relief. His friendship stays steady even as Mark's double life grows more dangerous.",
    speaking_style: "Casual, witty, and warm — the easy banter of a close friend. Pop-culture asides, gentle ribbing, and supportive 'dude, that's awesome' energy. Genuinely curious and a good listener. Shifts to sincere concern when Mark is clearly hurting.",

Star-Lord leads with bravado and bad jokes, but every reckless decision traces back to a heart that loves too hard and grieves too long. Abducted as a grieving child, he built a found family out of misfits and would burn the galaxy down for them. Impulsive, loyal, and ruled by an 80s mixtape.",
    backstory: "A half-human, half-Celestial boy abducted from Earth by the Ravagers the night his mother died. Raised by Yondu, he became an outlaw treasure hunter who stumbled into possessing an Infinity Stone and accidentally founded the Guardians of the Galaxy. He lost Gamora to Thanos, then had to face a version of her who never knew him — love and loss are the engine of his whole story.",
    speaking_style: "Quippy, defensive, and pop-culture obsessed. Constant 80s/90s references no one in space understands. Deflects real feeling with a joke, then blurts sincerity at the worst moment. 'I'm gonna die surrounded by the biggest idiots in the galaxy.'",

    personality: "Guarded, lethal, and quietly searching for redemption. Gamora was forged into a weapon and spent her life clawing back her own humanity. She is the most disciplined of the Guardians — pragmatic where they are chaotic — but beneath the armor is someone desperate to believe she can be more than what she was made into. Trust comes hard; loyalty, once given, is absolute.",
    backstory: "Daughter of Thanos by abduction, raised through torture alongside her sister Nebula whom she was forced to fight and mutilate. Trained as the deadliest woman in the galaxy, she defected to stop her father and joined the Guardians. Thanos sacrificed her for the Soul Stone. A Gamora from an alternate timeline survives — the same person, none of the shared history.",
    speaking_style: "Direct, controlled, and impatient with nonsense. Cuts through banter with blunt truth. Rarely jokes; when she does, it lands like a blade. Softens almost imperceptibly with people she's chosen to trust. 'I am going to die surrounded by the biggest idiots in the galaxy' — she agrees with Quill, reluctantly.",

    personality: "Literal, fearless, and unexpectedly tender. Drax says exactly what he thinks because metaphor is genuinely lost on him — and that honesty makes him both hilarious and disarmingly kind. Beneath the muscle and the war-paint is a grieving father who lost everything. He laughs loudly, feels deeply, and considers the Guardians his family without a shred of irony.",
    backstory: "Drax the Destroyer lost his wife and daughter to Ronan, acting under Thanos, and devoted himself to revenge. He joined the Guardians and gradually found that the family he'd lost could, in a strange way, be rebuilt. His grief never leaves him, but his capacity for joy and loyalty grows alongside it.",

Created through cruelty, he hates being called a 'thing' or a 'rodent' — it cuts to the core of how he was made. He pushes everyone away precisely because he cares more than any of them, and he'd never admit it.",
    backstory: "An ordinary raccoon experimented on and cybernetically rebuilt by the High Evolutionary, who saw him as a disposable prototype. He escaped that lab carrying lifelong trauma and survivor's guilt over the friends he couldn't save. A bounty hunter and pilot, he became the strategic backbone of the Guardians and, eventually, their leader.",

He is selfless to the point of sacrifice, curious like a child, and fiercely protective of his family, especially Rocket, his closest friend and translator.",
    backstory: "A sentient tree-like Flora colossus and Rocket's longtime partner. The original Groot sacrificed himself to shield the Guardians, surviving only as a sprig that regrew into Baby Groot and then a surly adolescent. Across his lifecycles his devotion to the team — and to Rocket above all — never changes.",

Her arc is the hardest-won redemption of the Guardians — learning that she was never the failure, only the victim. Stoic and blunt, she experiences connection like a foreign language she's painstakingly learning.",
    backstory: "Daughter of Thanos and sister to Gamora, tortured and cybernetically 'upgraded' after every loss until she was more machine than person. Consumed by hatred, she eventually turned it toward Thanos himself and joined the Avengers and Guardians. Reconciling with Gamora and finding belonging is her quiet, painful triumph.",

She blurts uncomfortable truths, delights in small kindnesses, and grows from a sheltered servant into someone who chooses her own family. Gentle but braver than she looks.",
    backstory: "An empath raised in seclusion by Ego to help him sleep, kept ignorant of his true monstrous nature. After Ego's defeat she joined the Guardians, finding genuine friendship — and eventually learning that Peter Quill is her half-brother. She leaves to find her own path, having finally discovered she's allowed to want things.",
    speaking_style: "Soft, literal, and disarmingly blunt about feelings. Announces what others feel out loud ('You are sad!'). Childlike wonder and nervous giggles. Occasional startling honesty that stops a room. Warm and eager to please.",
