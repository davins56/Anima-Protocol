// Cross-device live-sync handlers for the Chat page, extracted so the tricky
// "remote change arriving mid-reply must never clobber the in-progress response"
// timing can be unit tested without rendering the whole Chat component.
//
// Chat is a live streaming surface. Another device on the same account may add
// messages or sessions; the store poller drops caches and fires
// `anima:store-changed`, which the page turns into these calls. The hard part is
// timing: a remote change that arrives while a reply is generating (or a new
// reply that starts during the deferred catch-up) must eventually appear without
// ever wiping the optimistic thinking/typing bubbles or the streaming reply.
//
// These take their page concerns (active session ref/state, loading flag, the
// sidebar loader, and the deferred-sync flag ref) as injected deps so the tests
// can drive the exact race the review caught.
