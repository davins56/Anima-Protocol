// In-memory pub/sub for cross-device live sync push (SSE).
//
// The api-server runs as a single Node process, so a per-process registry of
// open SSE responses keyed by user id is enough: whenever a user's data
// changes (any successful mutating /store request), we write a one-line "store
// changed" signal to every stream that user currently has open. Clients react
// by re-checking the cheap /revision token (which carries the real change
// detection + self-write suppression), so this signal is intentionally just a
// nudge and never carries data itself.
//
// If the process restarts or the stream drops, clients fall back to their
// periodic /revision poll, so no change is ever permanently lost.
//
// MULTI-INSTANCE CAVEAT: this registry is process-local. If the api-server is
// ever scaled to more than one instance (or replicas behind a load balancer),
// a write handled by instance A only fans out to the SSE streams A holds —
// devices whose stream landed on instance B would NOT get an instant push and
// would instead wait for their next /revision poll. Correctness is preserved
// (the poll still catches it), only the "instant" feel is lost cross-instance.
// To make push work across instances, replace this in-memory Map with a shared
// pub/sub (e.g. Redis pub/sub or Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY): notifyUser publishes
// to a per-user channel, and each instance subscribes and writes to its own
// local streams. Until then, run the api-server as a single instance.
